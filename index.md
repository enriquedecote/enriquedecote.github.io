Research interests: My research connects computer science and economic theory, around the intersection between machine learning and game theory and optimization. I'm interested the computational aspects of rational decision making in two wide distinct settings: when the players do not have complete information and should gather information by interacting and learning from its environment and when players have information but are unable to accurately compute an exact solution.
